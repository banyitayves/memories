## LESSON DELIVERY TIMELINE & ACTIVITIES

| Phase | Description of Teaching/Learning Activity | Teacher Activities | Learner Activities |
|-------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Introduction** | **Generic Competencies:**<br/>• Communication and collaboration<br/>• Critical thinking<br/><br/>**Cross Cutting Issues:**<br/>• Gender equality<br/>• Environmental protection<br/><br/>**Short Explanation:** Activate prior knowledge about whole numbers and parts | Start with real-world scenario: "If we cut a pizza into 4 equal pieces and take 1 piece, what fraction did we take?" Ask guiding questions. Show various objects cut into equal parts. Engage students with interactive questioning. | Students observe objects cut into parts. Share prior knowledge about parts and wholes. Discuss examples given. Answer guiding questions about what they see. |
| **Development** | **Generic Competencies:**<br/>• Problem-solving<br/>• Creative thinking<br/><br/>**Cross Cutting Issues:**<br/>• Inclusive education<br/>• Quality assurance<br/><br/>**Short Explanation:** Build understanding through hands-on activities and group work | Demonstrate how to identify fractions using physical materials (pie charts, strips, blocks). Model naming fractions (numerator/denominator). Guide students through step-by-step examples. Monitor group work and provide feedback. | Work in pairs with fraction manipulatives. Copy fraction names from demonstration. Identify fractions in provided materials. Discuss in groups what each fraction represents. Solve guided practice problems. |
| **Conclusion** | **Generic Competencies:**<br/>• Reflection<br/>• Self-evaluation<br/><br/>**Cross Cutting Issues:**<br/>• Values and attitudes<br/><br/>**Short Explanation:** Consolidate learning and preview next lesson | Review main learning points through questioning. Ask students to reflect on what was difficult. Preview unit 4 on comparing fractions. Grade the activities. | Reflect on learning ("What did I understand today?") Create mind maps showing fraction concepts. Peer-check each other's work. Ask questions about next lesson. |

## ASSESSMENT METHODS

| Assessment Type | Description |
|---|---|
| **Formative Assessment** | - Classroom observation during partner activities<br/>- Question and answer sessions checking understanding<br/>- Student exit ticket: "Show me 1/4 using a drawing"<br/>- Peer assessment of fraction naming accuracy |
| **Summative Assessment** | - Draw and label different fractions (1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 2/4)<br/>- Identify fractions in pictures provided<br/>- Compare two fractions using visual models<br/>- Solve word problems involving fractions |

## TEACHING & LEARNING REFERENCES

**References (Textbooks & Curriculum Documents):**
- Rwanda Mathematics Curriculum Grade 5 (2015)
- MathMakers Textbook - Chapter 8: Fractions
- Numeracy for All - Fractions Resource Pack
- REB Guidelines for Inclusive Mathematics
- Real objects: pizza, apples, paper strips, circular shapes

## TEACHER SELF-EVALUATION

The lesson went well with most students understanding the basic concept of fractions. Visual learners benefited from the physical manipulatives. Two students struggled with the numerator/denominator concept and may need additional support. Next lesson, I'll provide more visual aids and perhaps create anchor charts for reference.

## SPECIAL NEEDS / INCLUSIVE EDUCATION NOTES

**For Visual Impairment:** Provide enlarged fraction diagrams (at least 3x normal size), texture-based fractions (raised lines), and verbal descriptions of all visual examples.

**For Hearing Impairment:** Use visual demonstrations extensively, write key terms on board, provide written instructions, pair with a supportive peer.

**For Physical Disabilities:** Ensure manipulatives can be handled independently or provide adapted gripping tools. Arrange seating for easy participation.

**For Learning Disabilities:** Pre-teach vocabulary, break activities into smaller steps, provide visual supports, use concrete materials before abstract representation.

**For Gifted Learners:** Challenge with improper fractions, equivalent fractions, and word problems involving multiple steps.
